The SOLID principles are a set of design principles that aim to create more maintainable, flexible, and scalable software. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and represent a foundation for good object-oriented design. The SOLID acronym stands for:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**
   - A class should have only one reason to change.
   - Each class or module should have a single responsibility, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**
   - Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   - You should be able to add new features or functionality without altering the existing code.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**
   - Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
   - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**
   - A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.
   - Many small, specific interfaces are better than a single, large, general-purpose interface.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
   - Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
   - Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.

These principles collectively promote modular design, flexibility, and maintainability in object-oriented systems. Following SOLID principles helps in creating code that is easier to understand, extend, and maintain, reducing the impact of changes and making the codebase more robust.
